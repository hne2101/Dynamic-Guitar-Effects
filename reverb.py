# Reverb
# Using a series of all pass filters

# read some audio file (real-time tbd)

# determine greatest delay value and store that number of values
# most efficent way to remove an item from one side of an array and add it to the other?


# Sample at some reasonable rate
# compute all pass filtered components (assuming signal has lasted long enough) and add
# play current audio
